# Tantaneh-SPA
This a framework for the automatic development of single-page web applications or SPA–based websites. The SPA–based websites run AJAX calls and client-side scripts while search engines do not run scripts within pages. Thus, SPA–based websites are not completely indexed by search engine crawlers. It is necessary that all AJAX requests in web applications can also be requested by static links. This library provides a method to suggests all ajax fine-grained calls are also indicated in links URLs. It allows us to design a SEO-friendly SPA-based website without any client-side programming. Moreover, you can load several pages, as subpages, inside a page in both server-side and client-side. This nested loading can be repeated without any limitation. <br /> <br />

For information on how the library works, you can refer to its [published article](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=dfsonmUAAAAJ&alert_preview_top_rm=2&citation_for_view=dfsonmUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C).<br />
You can find its demo on: [lib.tantaneh.com](http:/lib.tantaneh.com) <br /> <br />
Note: to test that it is completely SEO-friendly, you can disable javascript feature of the browser to see how still the site works correctly.
